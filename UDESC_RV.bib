This chapter reviews some of the most important existing theoretical explications. First, building on notions offered in literature, the core of the construct will be explicated: what exactly is meant by the term “Spatial Presence”? Second, theoretical views on the “feeling of being there” provided by different Presence researchers are introduced. Important aspects and determinants of Spatial Presence have been highlighted in the past, such as attentional processes and embodied cognition. However, coherent theoretical frameworks are rare and more empirical research seems necessary to advance the theoretical understanding of Spatial Presence. The chapter concludes with an overview about recent controversies and future trends in Spatial Presence research.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) can provide our minds with direct access to digital media in a way that seemingly has no limits. However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only is the system frustrating to use, but it can result in sickness. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book discusses these issues by emphasizing the human element of VR. The fact is, if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created. The VR principles discussed in this book will enable readers to intelligently experiment with the rules and iteratively design towards innovative experiences.},

  abstract = {Mixed reality boundaries establish transparent windows between physical and virtual spaces. We introduce a set of properties that allow such boundaries to be configured to support different styles of co-operative activity. These properties are grouped into three categories: permeability (properties of visibility, audibility and solidity); situation (properties of location, alignment, mobility and segmentation); and dynamics (properties of lifetime and configurability). We discuss how each of these properties can be technically realised. We also introduce the meta-properties of symmetry and representation. We then describe and compare two contrasting demonstrations, a performance and an office-door, that rely on different property configurations.}
